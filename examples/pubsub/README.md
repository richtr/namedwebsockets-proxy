Network Web Sockets PubSub Demo
===

A basic [publish/subscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishâ€“subscribe_pattern) demo on top of [Network Web Sockets](https://github.com/namedwebsockets/networkkwebsockets).

#### Running the example

1. Ensure a Network Web Socket Proxy has been downloaded and is currently running on your local machine. You can download a pre-built Network Web Socket Proxy [here](https://github.com/namedwebsockets/networkwebsockets/releases).

2. Open [`pubsub.html`](http://namedwebsockets.github.io/networkwebsockets/examples/pubsub/pubsub.html) on your local machine.

3. Open [`pubsub.html`](http://namedwebsockets.github.io/networkwebsockets/examples/pubsub/pubsub.html) in another browser window on the local machine or on another device that is also running a Network Web Socket Proxy within the local network.

4. Log in and out on one window using the interface provided and watch the authorization state get applied to the other window (and vice-versa).
