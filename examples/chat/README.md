Network Web Sockets Chat Demo
===

A simple chat client on top of [Network Web Sockets](https://github.com/namedwebsockets/networkwebsockets).

#### Running the example

1. Ensure a Network Web Socket Proxy has been downloaded and is currently running on your local machine. You can download a pre-built Network Web Socket Proxy [here](https://github.com/namedwebsockets/networkwebsockets/releases).

2. Open [`chat.html`](http://namedwebsockets.github.io/networkwebsockets/examples/chat/chat.html) in a browser window.

3. Open [`chat.html`](http://namedwebsockets.github.io/networkwebsockets/examples/chat/chat.html) in another browser window on the local machine or on another device that is also running a Network Web Socket Proxy within the local network.

4. Send messages from one chat window and watch the chat message appear in the other chat window (and vice-versa).
